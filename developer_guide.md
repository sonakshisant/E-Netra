# Developer Guide

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Dynamic Content Interpreter extension includes a Developer Mode that helps web developers identify and fix accessibility issues related to dynamic content. This guide explains how to use these features to improve the accessibility of your web applications.

## Enabling Developer Mode

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Microsoft Edge Add-ons
2. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
3. Select "Options" to open the settings page
4. Go to the "Advanced" tab
5. Check the "Developer Mode" option
6. Click "Save Settings"

Alternatively, you can enable Developer Mode temporarily by right-clicking anywhere on a page and selecting "AI Dynamic Content Interpreter" > "Developer Mode" from the context menu.

## Developer Mode Features

### 1. Accessibility Simulation

Developer Mode allows you to simulate how visually impaired users experience your website's dynamic content:

- **Screen Reader Simulation**: Highlights content as it would be announced by a screen reader
- **Focus Tracking**: Visualizes the focus path through interactive elements
- **Timing Visualization**: Shows delays between content updates and announcements

To use the simulation:

1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Click the "Simulate Screen Reader Experience" button in the extension popup
3. Interact with your website as a user would
4. Observe how dynamic content changes are detected and announced

### 2. Dynamic Content Inspection

Identify dynamic content that may cause accessibility issues:

- **Content Change Highlighting**: Visually highlights elements that change dynamically
- **Change Type Indicators**: Different colors indicate different types of changes (additions, removals, text changes, etc.)
- **Priority Visualization**: Shows the detected importance of each change

To inspect dynamic content:

1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Navigate to the "AI Accessibility" panel
4. Interact with your website to trigger dynamic content changes
5. Review the detected changes in the panel

### 3. Accessibility Issue Detection

The extension automatically detects common accessibility issues related to dynamic content:

- **Missing ARIA Attributes**: Identifies dynamic elements without proper ARIA roles or properties
- **Insufficient Context**: Highlights changes that lack proper context for screen readers
- **Focus Management Problems**: Detects when focus is not properly managed after content changes
- **Timing Issues**: Identifies updates that happen too quickly for users to process

Each issue includes:
- Severity level (Critical, Major, Minor)
- Description of the problem
- Location in the DOM
- Suggested fix

### 4. Accessibility Recommendations

Based on detected issues, the extension provides actionable recommendations:

- **Code Suggestions**: Specific code changes to improve accessibility
- **Best Practices**: General guidelines for different types of dynamic content
- **Framework-Specific Tips**: Recommendations tailored to React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.

Example recommendation:
```
CRITICAL: Live region not properly configured
Element: <div id="notification-area">
Problem: Dynamic content changes are not announced to screen readers
Recommendation: Add aria-live="polite" and aria-atomic="true" attributes
Suggested code: <div id="notification-area" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
```

### 5. Accessibility Testing

Developer Mode includes tools to test your accessibility improvements:

- **Test Scenarios**: Predefined tests for common dynamic content patterns
- **Custom Tests**: Create your own test cases for specific features
- **Regression Testing**: Verify that fixes don't introduce new issues

To run tests:

1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Open the browser's developer tools
3. Navigate to the "AI Accessibility" panel
4. Select the "Testing" tab
5. Choose a test scenario or create a custom test
6. Run the test and review results

### 6. Performance Monitoring

Monitor the performance impact of your dynamic content and accessibility features:

- **Update Frequency**: Track how often content changes
- **Processing Time**: Measure how long it takes to process updates
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption over time
- **CPU Impact**: Track CPU usage during dynamic updates

This helps you optimize your application for both accessibility and performance.

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Console Logging

Developer Mode adds detailed logging to the browser console:

- **Content Change Events**: Logs when dynamic content is detected
- **Accessibility Issues**: Reports problems as they're identified
- **Performance Metrics**: Records timing and resource usage

Access these logs through the browser's developer tools console.

### Framework Integration

The extension provides specific guidance for popular frameworks:

#### React

- Proper use of ARIA with React components
- Managing focus in React applications
- Accessible state updates and context

#### Angular

- Working with Angular's change detection
- Implementing accessible Angular directives
- Managing focus in Angular applications

#### Vue.js

- Accessible Vue components
- Managing reactivity for accessibility
- Focus management in Vue applications

### Export and Reporting

Generate reports to share with your team:

1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Interact with your website to trigger dynamic content
3. Open the "AI Accessibility" panel in developer tools
4. Click "Generate Report"
5. Choose the report format (HTML, PDF, or JSON)
6. Save or share the report

Reports include:
- Summary of detected issues
- Screenshots of problematic elements
- Code snippets with suggested fixes
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices for Dynamic Content Accessibility

### 1. Use Appropriate ARIA Live Regions

```html
<!-- For important updates that should interrupt the user -->
<div aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true">
  Important alert message
</div>

<!-- For non-critical updates -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  Status update message
</div>
```

### 2. Manage Focus Properly

```javascript
// After loading new content, move focus to the appropriate element
function loadNewContent() {
  // Load content
  fetchAndUpdateContent()
    .then(() => {
      // Find the heading in the new content
      const heading = document.querySelector('#new-content-heading');
      // Move focus to it
      if (heading) {
        heading.tabIndex = -1;
        heading.focus();
      }
    });
}
```

### 3. Provide Context for Changes

```html
<!-- Bad: No context -->
<div aria-live="polite">3</div>

<!-- Good: Provides context -->
<div aria-live="polite">Cart updated: 3 items</div>
```

### 4. Group Related Updates

```html
<!-- Group related updates to avoid multiple announcements -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  <p>Form submitted successfully</p>
  <p>Order #12345 confirmed</p>
  <p>Estimated delivery: May 30</p>
</div>
```

### 5. Control Update Frequency

```javascript
// Throttle frequent updates to avoid overwhelming the user
function throttleUpdates(updateFunction, delay) {
  let lastUpdate = 0;
  let pendingUpdate = null;
  
  return function() {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastUpdate >= delay) {
      lastUpdate = now;
      updateFunction();
    } else if (!pendingUpdate) {
      pendingUpdate = setTimeout(() => {
        lastUpdate = Date.now();
        updateFunction();
        pendingUpdate = null;
      }, delay - (now - lastUpdate));
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const throttledUpdate = throttleUpdates(updateLiveRegion, 1000);
```

## Troubleshooting Developer Mode

### Common Issues

**Developer panel doesn't appear in developer tools**
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in extension settings
- Try restarting the browser
- Check if there are conflicts with other developer extensions

**Changes aren't being detected**
- The website might use a non-standard method for updating content
- Try adjusting the detection sensitivity in Advanced Settings
- Check the console for error messages

**Recommendations aren't relevant to my framework**
- Specify your framework in the Developer Mode settings
- Check for framework-specific guides in the documentation
- Consider contributing framework-specific patterns to our GitHub repository
