# AI-Powered Dynamic Content Interpreter for Accessibility

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a browser extension that enhances web accessibility for visually impaired users by detecting, interpreting, and communicating dynamic content changes in real-time. The extension will use AI to provide contextual summaries of content updates, making them accessible to screen reader users who would otherwise miss these changes.

## Problem Statement
Visually impaired users who rely on screen readers face significant challenges with dynamic content on websites:
- Live updates (chats, stock tickers, sports scores, news feeds) often occur without proper ARIA notifications
- Screen readers typically don't announce content that updates without page navigation
- This creates an exclusionary experience where visually impaired users miss critical information
- Modern single-page applications (SPAs) built with React, Angular, or Vue.js exacerbate this problem

## Target Users
- Visually impaired individuals who use screen readers
- Web developers who want to test and improve the accessibility of their dynamic content
- Organizations committed to web accessibility compliance

## Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Content Detection
- Monitor DOM mutations to identify content changes in real-time
- Detect various types of dynamic updates (text changes, element additions, attribute modifications)
- Distinguish between significant content updates and trivial changes
- Work across different website architectures and frameworks

### 2. AI Context Summarization
- Use natural language processing to generate concise, meaningful summaries of content changes
- Provide context about what changed and why it matters
- Examples: "Stock prices rose 2% in the last 5 minutes" or "New message from John: Are we meeting today?"
- Balance detail with brevity for optimal screen reader experience

### 3. Priority Filtering
- Learn user preferences to prioritize important updates
- Filter out irrelevant content (ads, decorative changes)
- Allow users to set priority levels for different types of content
- Implement machine learning to improve filtering accuracy over time

### 4. Customizable Alerts
- Provide options for how updates are communicated (audio cues, vibration patterns)
- Allow customization based on content type and priority
- Ensure alerts are noticeable but not disruptive
- Support integration with existing screen readers

### 5. Framework Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js)
- Address specific challenges in single-page applications
- Provide consistent experience across different web technologies
- Handle complex DOM manipulations common in modern web apps

### 6. Developer Mode
- Create tools for developers to test their applications for dynamic content accessibility
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving accessibility
- Simulate screen reader experience with dynamic content
- Generate reports highlighting accessibility issues

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Extension
- Support for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Minimal performance impact on page loading and rendering
- Efficient DOM observation techniques
- Secure handling of page content

### AI Implementation
- Lightweight models to minimize latency (<100ms for updates)
- Efficient text processing for real-time summarization
- Privacy-preserving design (no unnecessary data collection)
- Fallback mechanisms when AI processing is unavailable

### Accessibility Standards
- Compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Support for major screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Implementation of appropriate ARIA attributes
- Adherence to accessibility best practices

## Success Criteria
- Successful detection and interpretation of dynamic content across diverse websites
- Accurate and helpful AI-generated summaries of content changes
- Latency under 100ms for real-time updates
- Positive feedback from visually impaired users during testing
- Compatibility with popular screen readers and browsers
- Minimal performance impact on web browsing experience

## Development Approach
1. Research & User Interviews: Partner with accessibility organizations to understand specific needs
2. Prototype Development: Create core functionality for content detection and summarization
3. AI Model Selection & Training: Optimize for accuracy and performance
4. User Testing: Gather feedback from visually impaired users
5. Iteration & Refinement: Improve based on user feedback
6. Documentation & Deployment: Prepare for public release

## Ethical Considerations
- Privacy: Ensure user data is protected and processed locally when possible
- Transparency: Clearly communicate how the extension works and what data it processes
- Inclusivity: Design with input from the visually impaired community
- Empowerment: Focus on enhancing user autonomy rather than creating dependencies
